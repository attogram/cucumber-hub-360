Before you throw away those cucumber peels, stop! The skins of cucumbers are packed with nutrients, insoluble fiber, and flavor. Embracing a zero-waste approach in the kitchen is not only good for the environment but also for your wallet and health.

### Waste Source: Cucumber Peels

The primary waste source when preparing many cucumber dishes is the skin. Whether you're peeling for a specific recipe's texture or dealing with a waxy conventional cucumber, these peels often end up in the compost or, worse, the trash. Let's put them to good use instead.

### Method 1: Create Infused Water

This is the easiest way to use cucumber peels. Simply drop them into a pitcher of cold water. Let it sit in the refrigerator for a few hours to infuse. The result is a refreshing, spa-like drink that encourages hydration.

- **Cost-Saving:** Flavored bottled waters can be expensive. This is a virtually free way to get delicious, infused water.

### Method 2: Make a Zesty Garnish

Finely chop the cucumber peels and mix them with a little salt, lemon juice, and herbs like mint or dill. This creates a vibrant, flavorful garnish for salads, grilled fish, or chicken, adding a pop of color and a fresh crunch.

### Method 3: Soothe Puffy Eyes

Cucumber peels have the same cooling and anti-inflammatory properties as the flesh. For a quick, refreshing beauty treatment, chill the peels in the refrigerator for 10-15 minutes, then place them over your closed eyes.

### Method 4: Pest Deterrent in the Garden

Some organic gardeners swear by placing cucumber peels in their gardens to deter pests like ants, wasps, and silverfish. The bitter compounds in the peel can be a natural repellent.

### Method 5: Boost Your Compost Pile

If you don't use the peels for anything else, they are a fantastic addition to your compost bin. As a "green" material, they add valuable nitrogen and moisture, which are essential for a healthy compost balance.

- **Compost Tip:** Always chop the peels into smaller pieces before adding them to your compost pile. This increases the surface area and helps them break down much faster.

    <p>On average, peels make up 15% of a cucumber's weight. If a household uses 2 cucumbers a week, you could be diverting over 5kg (11 lbs) of waste from landfills each year!</p>
