This Mediterranean Cucumber and Tomato Salad is the essence of summer on a plate. It's incredibly fresh, requires no cooking, and is packed with healthy ingredients. The simple lemon-herb vinaigrette ties everything together.

### Ingredients

- 1 English cucumber, chopped
- 1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1/2 red onion, thinly sliced
- 1/2 cup Kalamata olives, pitted and halved
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
- 1/4 cup fresh mint, chopped
- 4 oz feta cheese, crumbled (optional, omit for vegan)

**For the Vinaigrette:**

- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 3 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- Salt and black pepper to taste

### Steps

1.  **Combine Salad Ingredients:** In a large bowl, combine the chopped cucumber, halved cherry tomatoes, sliced red onion, Kalamata olives, parsley, and mint.
2.  **Make Vinaigrette:** In a small jar or bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper.
3.  **Dress the Salad:** Pour the vinaigrette over the salad ingredients and toss gently to combine.
4.  **Add Feta (Optional):** If using, gently fold in the crumbled feta cheese.
5.  **Rest and Serve:** Let the salad sit for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld, then serve.
