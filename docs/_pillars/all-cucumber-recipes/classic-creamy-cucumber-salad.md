This classic creamy cucumber salad is the perfect side dish for any summer barbecue, picnic, or weeknight dinner. It's light, refreshing, and the creamy dill dressing perfectly complements the crispness of the cucumbers and the sharp bite of red onion.

### Ingredients

- 2 large English cucumbers, thinly sliced
- 1/2 red onion, thinly sliced
- 1 cup sour cream or full-fat Greek yogurt
- 2 tablespoons white vinegar
- 1 tablespoon fresh dill, chopped
- 1 teaspoon sugar (optional, to balance acidity)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

### Steps

1.  **Prepare Cucumbers:** Place the thinly sliced cucumbers in a colander and sprinkle generously with salt. Let them sit for 20-30 minutes. This process, called disgorging, draws out excess water and ensures a crisp salad that isn't watery.
2.  **Rinse and Dry:** Gently rinse the salt from the cucumbers under cold water and pat them thoroughly dry with paper towels or a clean kitchen towel. Don't skip this step!
3.  **Make Dressing:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the sour cream (or Greek yogurt), white vinegar, fresh dill, sugar (if using), salt, and pepper until the dressing is smooth and well combined.
4.  **Combine:** Add the dried cucumber slices and thinly sliced red onion to the bowl with the dressing. Gently stir until everything is well-coated.
5.  **Chill:** For the best flavor, cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving. This allows the flavors to meld together beautifully.
