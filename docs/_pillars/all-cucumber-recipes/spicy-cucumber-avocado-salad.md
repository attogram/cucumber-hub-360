This Spicy Cucumber and Avocado Salad is a flavor explosion. The creaminess of the avocado, the crispness of the cucumber, and the kick from the serrano pepper create a perfectly balanced dish that's both healthy and satisfying.

### Ingredients

- 1 large English cucumber, diced
- 2 ripe avocados, diced
- 1/2 cup red onion, finely chopped
- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
- 1 serrano or jalape√±o pepper, minced (remove seeds for less heat)
- Juice of 2 limes
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and black pepper to taste

### Steps

1.  **Prepare Vegetables:** In a large bowl, gently combine the diced cucumber, diced avocado, chopped red onion, and cilantro. Be careful not to mash the avocado.
2.  **Make Dressing:** In a small bowl, whisk together the lime juice, olive oil, minced serrano pepper, salt, and pepper.
3.  **Combine and Serve:** Pour the dressing over the cucumber and avocado mixture. Toss gently to combine. For the best texture and color, serve immediately.
