The first step to a successful cucumber harvest is choosing the right variety. With hundreds to choose from, the decision can be daunting. This guide breaks down the main types to help you select the perfect cucumber for your garden and kitchen.

### Variety Table: Slicing vs. Pickling

| Type     | Key Characteristics                                | Best For                              | Popular Varieties           |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Slicing  | Longer, thinner skin, high water content.          | Salads, sandwiches, fresh eating.     | English, Marketmore 76      |
| Pickling | Short, stout, bumpy skin, less water content.      | Pickling, canning.                    | Boston Pickling, Kirby      |
| Burpless | Low cucurbitacin, less bitter, easier to digest.   | Fresh eating, for sensitive stomachs. | Sweet Success, Beit Alpha   |
| Bush     | Compact plants, ideal for small spaces/containers. | Small gardens, container gardening.   | Spacemaster, Bush Champion  |
| Vining   | Sprawling vines, high yield, require trellising.   | Large gardens, vertical gardening.    | Straight Eight, Poinsett 76 |

### Sow-Time

- **Indoors:** Start seeds indoors 3-4 weeks before the last expected frost date. Cucumbers grow fast, so don't start them too early.
- **Outdoors:** Sow seeds directly into the garden soil only after all danger of frost has passed and the soil temperature has reached at least 65°F (18°C).

### Care

- **Sunlight:** Cucumbers need full sun, at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day.
- **Soil:** Plant in rich, well-drained soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Mix in plenty of compost or aged manure before planting.
- **Watering:** Provide consistent and ample water, about 1-2 inches per week. Inconsistent watering can lead to bitter-tasting cucumbers.
- **Trellising:** Vining varieties should be grown on a trellis or fence. This saves space, keeps the fruit off the ground (preventing rot), and improves air circulation, which reduces disease risk.

### Harvest

- Harvest cucumbers when they are the appropriate size for their variety. Don't let them get too large or yellow, as they will become bitter.
- Check plants daily once they start producing. The more you harvest, the more the plant will produce.
- Use a knife or pruning shears to cut the cucumbers from the vine, leaving a small piece of the stem attached.

### Common Pests

- **Cucumber Beetles:** These yellow and black beetles can damage plants and transmit bacterial wilt. Use row covers on young plants or introduce beneficial insects like ladybugs.
- **Powdery Mildew:** A white, dusty fungus that appears on leaves. Ensure good air circulation by trellising and avoid overhead watering.
