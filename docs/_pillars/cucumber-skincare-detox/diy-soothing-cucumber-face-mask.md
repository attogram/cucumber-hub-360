Unlock the secret to calm, hydrated skin with a face mask you can make right in your kitchen. This DIY Soothing Cucumber Face Mask is packed with natural ingredients that work together to reduce redness, fight inflammation, and give you a healthy glow.

### Ingredient Benefits

- **Cucumber:** Composed of 96% water, it's incredibly hydrating. It also contains Vitamin C and caffeic acid, which help soothe skin irritation and reduce swelling. Its cooling effect is instant relief for tired or irritated skin.
- **Plain Yogurt:** Contains lactic acid, a natural alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) that gently exfoliates dead skin cells, smooths skin, and can help reduce the appearance of fine lines. The probiotics can also help balance the skin's microbiome.
- **Honey (Optional):** A natural humectant, it draws moisture into the skin. It's also naturally antibacterial and anti-inflammatory, making it great for acne-prone or irritated skin.

### Preparation

**What you'll need:**

- 1/2 a cucumber, peeled and chopped
- 2 tablespoons of plain, unsweetened yogurt (full-fat is best for extra moisture)
- 1 tablespoon of raw honey (optional)

**Instructions:**

1.  Place the chopped cucumber in a blender or food processor and blend until it becomes a smooth puree.
2.  In a small bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of the cucumber puree with the yogurt and honey (if using). Stir until you have a smooth, consistent paste. You can add more or less puree to get your desired consistency.

### Application

1.  **Cleanse:** Start with a clean, dry face. Gently wash and pat dry.
2.  **Apply:** Using your fingertips or a clean brush, apply an even layer of the mask to your face and neck, avoiding the sensitive eye and mouth areas.
3.  **Relax:** Lie back and relax for 15-20 minutes. This is a great time to place the classic cool cucumber slices over your eyes to help reduce puffiness.
4.  **Rinse:** Rinse the mask off with lukewarm water and gently pat your skin dry with a soft towel.
5.  **Moisturize:** Follow up with your favorite serum and moisturizer to lock in the hydration.

### Safety & Patch Testing

Even with natural ingredients, allergic reactions are possible. Before applying the mask to your face, **always perform a patch test**. Apply a small amount to a discreet area, like your inner arm or behind your ear. Wait 24 hours to ensure there is no redness, itching, or irritation.

### FAQ

**Q: How often can I use this mask?**
A: This mask is gentle enough to use 2-3 times a week, depending on your skin's needs.

**Q: Can I store the leftover mask?**
A: It's best to make a fresh batch for each use to ensure ingredient potency and prevent bacteria growth. If you must store it, place it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for no more than 24 hours.
